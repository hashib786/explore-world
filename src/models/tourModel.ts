A virtual property in Mongoose is a calculated field that doesn't store data in the database. It's defined on a schema, and your provided code example computes a virtual property called durationWeeks, which calculates the tour duration in weeks based on the existing duration field. This calculated value isn't stored but is available when you access tour.durationWeeks. 
Note : this is not accesable when you query
